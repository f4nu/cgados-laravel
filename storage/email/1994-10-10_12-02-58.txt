Dear Mario,
 
Your recent update is extremely concerning. Understand this clearly: failure to resolve these issues immediately puts our entire operation at risk. We cannot afford to miss this opportunity with Aperture Science; doing so will have catastrophic consequences for Ferrero.
 
If we cannot successfully develop and launch the Lemon Kinder Pingu√¨, we risk not only the closure of all our facilities but also the real possibility of not surviving until the end of the year. You must find a way to stabilize the formula and ensure it passes all safety protocols.
 
Mobilize all necessary resources and work around the clock if needed. Failure is not an option.
 
Regards,
 
Giovanni Rossi
