Dear Giovanni,
 
I regret to inform you that we are encountering significant issues with the development of the Lemon Kinder Pinguì. The product is failing multiple tests and, alarmingly, it appears to be highly volatile and potentially combustible.
 
Despite our best efforts, we have not been able to stabilize the formula. The reaction with the lemon essence is unpredictable and appears to be causing a series of unwanted chemical reactions. Several batches have resulted in minor explosions in the lab, raising serious safety concerns.
 
We need to address this as a matter of urgency. I recommend halting further development until we figure out how to neutralize these reactions. Your immediate guidance would be greatly appreciated.
 
Best regards,
 
Mario Bianchi
