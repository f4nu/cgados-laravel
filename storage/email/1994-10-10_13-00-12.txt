Dear Aperture Science Team,
 
I am writing to address the critical situation concerning the Lemon Kinder Pinguì development. It is imperative to note that while we are collaborating on this project, the circumstances have changed significantly since the days when Cave Johnson had a direct influence over Ferrero’s operations. Your position as partners is currently far from favorable, and your request carries considerable operational risk for us.
 
Our teams are working tirelessly to overcome the volatile and combustible nature of the product. Nevertheless, I must manage expectations: while we are committed to finding a solution, I cannot guarantee the successful completion of this product under the given timeframe and conditions.
 
Thank you for your understanding.
 
Sincerely,
 
Luca Ferrero
 
CEO, Ferrero
