Dear Margaret,
 
Thank you for the urgent update. I want to reassure you and the team that the design of the interface inherently limits access to higher data levels without the required physical connection.
 
As you know, the interface relies on a direct neural link. This neural link connects directly to the user's brain, allowing them to experience and interact with virtual environments as though they were real. Due to the sophistication of this interface, critical data and deeper system functionalities are only accessible via authenticated neural pathways, which cannot be replicated through standard digital means.
 
The current breach appears to be limited to the initial data layer, which serves primarily as a buffer and contains minimal sensitive information. Our current protocols should be effective in preventing the intruder from advancing any further without the physical interface.
 
I will be joining the emergency meeting at 10:00 AM to provide further technical details and to assist in developing our response strategy. In the meantime, I recommend increasing monitoring on the server and initiating a detailed log review to track the point of access. 
 
Please rest assured that our layered security protocols were designed with such scenarios in mind, and the integrity of the deeper system remains intact.
 
Best regards,
 
Jonathan Reed
Lead Interface Architect
