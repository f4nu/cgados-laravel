Dear Giovanni,
 
I was deeply saddened to hear about the passing of your father Pietro. On behalf of myself and Cave, please accept our sincerest condolences. Pietro was a remarkable man, and his legacy will live on through the incredible work he started with Ferrero.
 
We are thinking of you and your family during this difficult time. If there is anything we can do to support you, please do not hesitate to reach out.
 
Con affetto e che la vostra famiglia trovi coraggio e conforto.
 
Warmest regards,
 
Caroline
