CGaDOS Team,
 
I am forwarding the previous communication with Dr. Michele Ferrero, ensuring him of the immediate return of the coffin and proceeding as per contract.
 
You may now initiate the consciousness transfer into the new vessel. Given the sensitive and complex nature of this procedure, it will take several days to complete. To ensure utmost precision and safety, all personnel involved must remain in the underground facilities until the operation is finalized.
 
Starting this evening, a new quarantine will be enforced. Make sure you are fully prepared and have all necessary supplies to operate without interruptions.
 
For any urgent needs, I am available.
 
Best of luck,
 
Luca Moretti
 
Logistics Operations Manager
