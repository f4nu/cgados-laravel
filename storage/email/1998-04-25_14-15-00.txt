Dear Team,
 
I am writing to inform you about a critical technical issue we have encountered with the ventilation systems that is currently preventing us from accessing levels deeper than floor -28 in the salt mine infrastructure.
 
As you are aware, the area in question is located approximately 400 meters below ground level. At such significant depths, the temperature and air quality conditions present unique challenges that require our ventilation systems to operate flawlessly. Unfortunately, it appears that there has been a malfunction in the primary cooling and air circulation units, which are essential for maintaining safe and breathable air in these deep subterranean sections.
 
The importance of this ventilation system cannot be overstated. Without proper air circulation and conditioning, the deeper levels of the mine rapidly become inhospitable due to high temperatures and poor air quality. This environment poses serious health risks to our personnel, which is why we have made the decision to temporarily halt all operations beyond floor -28 until the issue is resolved.
 
Our engineering team is currently investigating the cause of the malfunction. Preliminary assessments suggest that we may be dealing with a failure in the main cooling units, possibly due to overloading or wear and tear from prolonged use. Our technical experts are working around the clock to diagnose the problem and procure the necessary parts for repairs.
 
We understand the critical nature of the work that takes place in these deeper sections and the potential impact this has on our project timelines. Rest assured, this situation has our full attention and we are prioritizing resolving this issue as quickly and safely as possible. I will provide regular updates on the progress of the repairs and any changes to our operational capabilities.
 
In the meantime, please follow all safety protocols and avoid accessing the restricted areas. If you have any further questions or require additional information, do not hesitate to contact me directly.
 
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
 
Best regards,
