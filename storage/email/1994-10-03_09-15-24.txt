Dear Mario,
 
We have an urgent request from Aperture Science to develop a new Kinder Pinguì with a lemon flavor. They have an excess of thousands of tons of lemons that need immediate utilization. This is an exceptional opportunity for us to create a distinctive and appealing new product.
 
You must begin *immediatamente* to design and test recipes for the Lemon Kinder Pinguì. Please prioritize this project above all others. I want to see a prototype ready within the next two weeks.
 
Let’s turn this challenge into an opportunity for innovation and success. Aggiornami sui progressi.
 
Best regards,
 
Giovanni Rossi
